# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

 PaaS is a cloud service that provides developers with everything they need to build and execute applications, including servers, storage, databases, and tools, without the need to manage infrastructure.  It helps to speed up development and reduce setup time.
 
**How It Works**

 The service provider is in charge of managing servers, operating systems, scaling, and security.  Developers simply write, upload, and deploy their code.
 Types

* Public PaaS - Hosted by organizations such as AWS and Google Cloud.

* Private PaaS - Used within an organization's internal systems.

* Hybrid PaaS combines public and private services.

**Benefits**
